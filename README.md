# CyborgNet
CyborgNet is a standard protocol for communication between implants in the human body, this repo contains specifications of the protocol and a reference implementation.

See docs/protocol.txt for details on the protocol itself and look in hubserver/ for a python implementation of the hub server.

client/ contains a client library and any software modules that can connect to the hub, mostly for testing purposes at this point, though some will eventually be a core part
